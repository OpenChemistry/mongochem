Contributing
------------

Our project uses Gerrit for code review, and CDash@Home to test proposed
patches before they are merged. Please check our [development][Development]
guide for more details on developing and contributing to the project. The
[project pages][Projects] provide bug, feature and support trackers, along
with many other features such as source browsing.

Our [wiki][Wiki] is used to document features, flesh out designs and host other
documentation. Our API is [documented using Doxygen][Doxygen] with updated
documentation generated nightly. We have several [mailing lists][MailingLists]
to coordinate development and to provide support.
